# GNN_Node_Classification
GNN is Graph structure represents the data.
It carry out node classification, link prediction, graph classification
Node classification 
          - applied to large graphs including labelled and unlabelled nodes.
          - predicts the node embeddings
          - approach used to predict the unlabelled nodes is message technique
          - Graph Convolutional Networks(GCN) performs message passing
Implementation of node classification are Citation networks/citation graph, reddit posts, youtube videos etc...

Objectives:

  The main objective of this project is to build a Graph Neural Network for 	predicting the unlabelled nodes.
  To predict the subject of a paper given its words and the citations network
  To implement GCN layers for message passing task.
  
Scope of the project:

Is helpful for machine learning applications which have the structural relationship between their entities that can be best represented as graphs.So finding the unlabelled nodes in the GNN is crucial for solving many real-world problems.
Also graphs simplifies complex problems by giving simple representation for it.
